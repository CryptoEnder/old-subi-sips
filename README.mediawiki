=Subi Improvement Proposals (SIP)=

==Description==
A Subi Improvement Proposal (SIP) is a design document providing information to the Subi community, or describing a new feature for Subi or its processes or environment. The SIP should provide a concise technical specification of the feature and a rationale for the feature.

We intend SIPs to be the primary mechanisms for proposing new features, for collecting community input on an issue, and for documenting the design decisions that have gone into Subi. The SIP author is responsible for building consensus within the community and documenting dissenting opinions.
